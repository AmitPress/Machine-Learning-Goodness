and on the potential of AI in the art [here](https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/is-ai-art-really-art-a363073d62d0) that may lead to the future of social activism.

##  Algorithms, Category Theory in ML & ML experiment tracking | Day 8

+ Finished 'Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people' by Aditya Y. Bhargava
that can be found as item **1** [here](#worthy-books). Recommend it highly as algorithms are explained simply through visualisations
and some usage of algorithms in ML is visualised as well. Loved it. Also found another technical book of Steven Skiena's 'Algorithm Design Manual' 
by reading its preface that will help to hone expertise on algorithms further as it can be found as item **2** [here](#worthy-books) with videos that complement
the book [here](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/373/videos/).

+ Began diving into Category Theory and its usage in Machine Learning. A nice GitHub repository that lists all of the
relevant papers which can be found as item **4** [here](#worthy-repositories) while to get a good grasp of Category Theory started
reading the book of Category Theory for Programmers by Bartosz Milewski [here](https://www.scribd.com/document/387084492/Category-Theory-for-Programmers)
as also it can be inspected through [here](#worthy-books) as item **3** where a blog on which the book is based is given.

+ Dived into ML experiment tracking [here](https://neptune.ai/blog/ml-experiment-tracking) that in a few words is the process of saving all the experiment related information.

##  Automated ML, Algorithm Design Manual & Logistic Regression | Day 9

+ To work out how we could automate all aspects of ML and data analysis pipeline found this awesome book as item **4** [here](#worthy-books). I highly recommend it to any machine learning researcher
wanting to get started in the field and to any practitioner looking to understand the methods behind all the AutoML tools out there. Do check it out.
After finishing with the current technical book that is going to be my the third technical book of the year to go hand in hand with [this one](https://www.scribd.com/document/387084492/Category-Theory-for-Programmers).

+ Started reading 'Algorithm Design Manual' to refresh as well as strengthen knowledge on algorithms used in Machine Learning and Computer Science
as full book can be found as item **2** [here](#worthy-books) with videos that complement the book [here](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/373/videos/).

+ To clear my insights on Logistic Regression I was searching on the internet for some well documented sources and came across the article
as item **6** [here](#worthy-tools). It provides a detailed description of Logistic Regression and I recommend to check it out.


##  Support Vector Machines & Brain-Computer Interface | Day 10

+ Strengthened understanding on what Support Vector Machine is, how it is used to solve classification problems and honed expertise about its usage.
+ Made a graphical summary of SVM below as well as [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Machine-Learning-Goodness/blob/main/Public/Images/Day_10_Support_Vector_Machines.jpg).
+ Looked at Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) as a good summary is given as item **7** [here](#worthy-tools) and a nice article on research fascinating news as item **8** [here](#worthy-tools)

</p>

## Code on SVM & AI in Chemistry| Day 11

+ Implemented Support Vector Machine (SVM) on linearly related data while using Scikit-Learn. As in this library we have SVC classifier I used it to solve the task. 
The code snippet of it can be found [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Machine-Learning-Goodness/blob/main/Code/Day_11_SVM.md).
+ Coming from chemical background made me hyper excited to study about ML influence on Chemistry 
through diving into it while reading a number of articles of which some highlights could be **9**, **10**, **11** & **12** as found [here](#worthy-tools).

## Notebooks on PyTorch Tensors & Visualisations | Day 12

+ Made two Jupyter notebooks. One with simple analysis of PyTorch Tensors as found 
[here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Machine-Learning-Goodness/blob/main/Notebooks/Day_12_Example_of_PyTorch_and_Numpy_tensors.ipynb) 
and the other on visualising Neural Networks through Pytorch 
[here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Machine-Learning-Goodness/blob/main/Notebooks/Day_12_Example_of_some_PyTorch_visualisations.ipynb).
  

## Perceptron with PyTorch, Naive Bayes Classifier & Black Box ML | Day 13

+ Made a notebook with a simple overview of Perceptron theory and its usage through PyTorch as found 
[here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Machine-Learning-Goodness/blob/main/Notebooks/Day_13_Example_of_PyTorch_with_Perceptron.ipynb).

# Machine Learning in Chemistry | Day 17

Read about Machine Learning concepts in Chemistry and particularly in automating and predicting chemical 
reactions as well as other chemical niceties:

1. Most cited article is on the reaction predictions for organic chemistry where these reactions were 
explored by the use of neural networks. This newly developed predictor built a system which predicts the likely products of these reaction. 
Further details found as item **19** [here](#worthy-tools) or accessed though [here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.6b00219).
2. Machine Learning methods (Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest) looked at the compatibility of 
specific chemical processes and the feasability of these predicted reactions. The link as item **20** found [here](#worthy-tools) 
or accessed though [here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci500698a)

Public folder contains two files:

# Jupyter in Browser
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

First nice thing is that you could run Jupyter also through browser by doing so going [here](https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo/lab/index.html) and 
reading more about it in this [article](https://medium.com/geekculture/run-jupyter-notebooks-on-a-web-browser-using-jupyterlite-18e3bd25bd97).

If you find difficulty in running Jupyter Notebook through Browser then you could use Google Colab by clicking 
[here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). Functionalities of both machines are similar.
