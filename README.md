<b> Overview </b> 
</p>
<p align=left>
With the start of #100DaysOfMLCode challenge this Machine Learning Goodness repository is updated daily with either 
the completed Jupyter notebooks, Python codes, ML projects, useful ML/DL/NN libraries, cheat codes of ML/DL/NN/AI, useful information 
such as websites, beneficial learning materials, tips and whatnot not to mention some basic and advanced Python coding.

[//]: # (### K Nearest Neighbours and Universal Intelligence | Day 6)

[//]: # (+ Added a publication &#40;**5**&#41; on Universal Intelligence: A Definition of Machine Intelligence [here]&#40;#worthy-repositories&#41; )

[//]: # (that looks into informal definitions of intelligence defined by experts, then mathematically looks into what )

[//]: # (is intelligence for machines and investigates other tests and definitions of intelligence proposed for machines.)

[//]: # (+ Added a graphical summary of K Nearest Neighbours below and [here]&#40;https://github.com/aurimas13/Machine-Learning-Goodness/blob/main/Public/Images/Multiple_Linear_Regression.png&#41;)

# Public
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Public folder contains two files: 
- [todolist](https://github.com/aurimas13/Machine-Learning-Goodness/blob/main/Public/todolist.txt) - the TO DO List.
- [Images](https://github.com/aurimas13/Machine-Learning-Goodness/tree/main/Public/Images) - the Images folder.


# Jupyter in Browser
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

First nice thing is that you could run Jupyter also through browser by doing so going [here](https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo/lab/index.html) and 
reading more about it in this [article](https://medium.com/geekculture/run-jupyter-notebooks-on-a-web-browser-using-jupyterlite-18e3bd25bd97).

If you find difficulty in running Jupyter Notebook through Browser then you could use Google Colab by clicking 
[here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). Functionalities of both machines are similar.
